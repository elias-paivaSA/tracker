Habit Tracker repository - 12/05/2025

 - This app will be a habit tarcker, which will allow me to tarck my habits on a daily basis.
 - It should have a login page, that will allow me to login with Google, Facebook and X.
 - The login page should show on the screen in case there is something wrong with the login credentials.
 - On the login page, there will be a call for the sign up page.
 - The sign up page will ask for requirements from the user.

✅ Mobile (≤ 767px):
No image
. Just the form, centered and vertical
. Fastest, cleanest, pure UX

✅ Tablet (768px – 1024px):
. Use a simplified version of the image
. Split screen only if it doesn’t make the form too narrow
. Watch out for landscape mode — it gives you room

✅ Desktop (≥ 1025px):
. Go full: image + form side by side
. Maybe even animated or branded background on the image side
